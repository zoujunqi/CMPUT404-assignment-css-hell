Part1 Modification
====================
Inside the html files, I correct the path to the cover image since the old one from the web doesn't work any more.
Also, I apply the css file to the three html files by link.
In the css file, what i did is to change the font of title, and change the font, 
the background color and also font size of the content.
I change the color of headers and content to some color similar to navy because I think
it matches the old book like color of background.
I also change the margin of the page so more content can be displayed.
Image is themed and image captions are added.
